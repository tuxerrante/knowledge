You can ask an increase in Sub resource limits

- Resouce groups
resources can be in only one RG
groups can not be nested
locks can prevent deletions or modifications

- management groups

  global spending budgets

- tagging
  logically organization in taxonomy

- Costs
differ by location, inbound/outbound traffic
pre-pay azure reserved instances
re-use on-prem licenses


- Azure Policies
resource types, SKU, location, required tags, backups
You can combine multiple policies deletions in an INITIATIVE

  resource group
  
- RBAC
bind a role definition to a user, group or Service Principal

- Resource manager (ARM)
Deploy update or delete multiple resources in coordination
When you send a request through any of the Azure APIs, tools, or SDKs, Resource Manager receives the request.

4 IPs are reserverd by Azure.
Each subnet need its own address range.

.0 : Network address
.1 : Reserved by Azure for the default gateway
.2,.3 : Reserved by Azure to map the Azure DNS IPs to the VNet space
.255 : Network broadcast address.

Private IP addresses: VPN gateway or ExpressRoute

Public IPs costs around 5€ per month
You can buy one to expose a Load Balancer

Rules:
  - Source
  - Destination
  - Service

- App Security Groups
group VM and Servers
You can wrap the ASG with a NSG

- Firewall
Stateful service.
Hihly available and scalable.
Log applications
Threat filtering.
Price around 10.000€year + extra GB traffic

   Hub    - Spoke architecture
Bastion   |         |   VM1
Firewall  | peering |   VM2

- Azure DNS zones
hosts the DNS records for a domain.
Child zones are registered in the parent domain.
20 records per record set.

Private DNS zones
name resoultion for VMs in a VNET
reverse DNS resolution works only in the same VNET

- VPN Gateway

- PEERING

Global and Regional

Uses Azure backbone

Allow gateway Trasit

- VPN (virtual network) GW
1 GW subnet
2 VPN GW
  route or policy based. VPN/ExpressRoute. Public IP. 
  site-to-site (S2S/ IPSEC) and Net-to-VNet
  By default Active/Standby 
3 Local network GW
   refers to the on-premises location
4 VPN device on-premise
5 VPN connection
+ UDR 

- ExpressRoute Direct
connect directly into Microsoft's global network at peering location.
ExpressRoute Direct provides dual 100 Gbps or 10 Gbps connectivity, which supports Active/Active connectivity at scale.
Always S2S

- User defined Routes
route table contains routes for packages in a vnet

Private Link VS Peering ?
Private Endpoint can be connected with Private Link to other resources



- LOAD BALANCER
Application gateway: 
  Http, Https, WAF, Private (region specific), also non Azure resources
Front Door: 
  microservice apps, HTTP HTTPS, Global, WAF, NSG
Load Balancer:
  TCP, UDP, private balancing between Azure resources
  SKU: 
    Basic: no SLA
    Standard: any kind of VM o VM set
  Session persistance
  
Traffic Manager: 
  based on DNS distributes traffic between global public resources.
  

- Network Watcher
Regional service.
Next HOP check.
Connectivity issues.
VPN diagnostics.
IP flow verifier: ping + tracer.


==============================
STORAGE
==============================
local disk hard drives for creating a big pool on the hyperV server

Containers
    BLOB: unstructured data (img, web docs, video, audio...)
    accounts have unlimited containers
Tables
  structured, non relational data
Queues
  FIFO storage for msg
Files
  VM hard drives
  SMB + REST interface
  incremental Snapshot
  File Sync (extend on-prem storage): 
    storage sync service
    prepare win server
    install agent
    register win server

Containers + Files
  Access Tiers: 
    Hot = frequent access
    Cool = large amount of data not freq accessed
    Archive = hours of retrieval latency
    You can switch between them.
  Lifecycle management rules.

Storage Account
  standard 
  premium blobs
  premium file: high performance  file share apps
  premium page blobs
All data is locked by Storage Service Encryption (SSE)

Replication:
- LRS:  1 region, 3 replicas
- ZRS:  1 region, 3 replicas, 3 zones
- GRS:  2 regions, 6 replicas
- RA-GRS
- GZRS: 6 rep, 3+1 zon, 2 reg
- RA-GZRS

You should restrict network access to the St Ac after creation.

A shared access signature (SAS) is a URI that grants restricted access to an Azure Storage blob.

VM

Can't change VNet anymore
os disk + temp disk + data disk
os and data disk reside in storage accounts
Best to use SSH connection behind a VPN GW

Availability Zones

You need a backup agent to transfer data to the vault.
1. create recovery service vault
2. download and install the agent and credential file
3. configure the backup

Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) Agents.

- Azure backup vault  -> blobs, disks, postgreSQL, AKS services
