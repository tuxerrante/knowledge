# Building Wealth
Hard work matters but it has to be directed in the right direction: know what to do, how to do it and with who.

Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep.

Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).

Code is the most powerful permissionless leverage.

Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate.

Figure out which things you can provide for society that it does not yet know how to get.

Escape competition by authenticity.

You can only achieve mastery in one or two things. something you're obsessed about and that you can iterate over everyday.

Find the 1% of your discipline that won't be wasted, where you can invest trough all your life, go all-in and leave out the rest.

If you don't own equities in a business, you're chances of making good money is very slim.

Don't look at jobs where input and output are highly connected. That won't create wealth.

Do it for the sake of it, not for money. Id you love money and you make it, that's never enough.

Networking at all costs is bullshit. Do your craft, practice your craft and the Right people will come to you.

Keep doing it. don't keep track. don't count. have a lot of patience.
