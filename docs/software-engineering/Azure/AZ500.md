# AUTHN

Components:

Portal, Oauth2, OIDC, MSGraph APIs, open source libraries (MSAL)…

## Service Principals

An application registered in EntraID gets a global unique object ID and a service principal.

The app can be single tenant or multi-tenant.

Object ID: scoped across the home tenant. It is like a class with static properties used as template to create the app instances through service principals.

It defines mainly:

- How to issue tokens
- Resources available
- Actions permitted

Service principal:

An app registration will create a SP, with specific permissions (eg: delegated).

- Application: App Instance = SP single tenant representation of a global object ID.
- [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview): for services supporting EntraID authn. Can have permissions updates but not direct edits.  
    No need to manage certificates in the app.

- System assigned: 1 identity <--> 1 managed SP  
    If you require that each resource has its own identity, or have resources that require a unique set of permissions and want the identity to be deleted as the resource is deleted, then you should use a system-assigned identity.
- User assigned:     N to N map to resources  
    User-assigned identities can be used by multiple resources, and their life cycles are decoupled from the resources’ life cycles with which they’re associated.

[Best practice recommendations for managed system identities - Managed identities for Azure resources | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/managed-identity-best-practice-recommendations)

- Legacy

You can login directly against the cloud IdP or to a [Passthrough authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-pta-quick-start) agent.  
With Pass-through Authentication, the user’s password is validated against the on-premises Active Directory, ensuring a secure and seamless authentication experience.

AADS/[Entra Domain Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/domain-services/overview) creates managed Domain Controllers in another VNet to sync the authentication of users coming from another IdP. It is only synced from the Main DC to the managed replicas direction.

## [Entra Domain Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/domain-services/overview)
Two Windows domain controller server are deployed in the Azure cloud to create a new domain connected to the legacy AD.
The synch is one-way from the legacy on-prem to the cloud managed replica.
HA through multiple DC replicas.

**NTLM**
- requires an application server to connect to a domain controller to authenticate every client computer or service.
- NTLM does not enable clients to verify a server's identity or enable one server to verify the identity of another. NTLM authentication was designed for a network environment in which servers were assumed to be genuine. The Kerberos protocol makes no such assumption.

- LDAP

## SSO

## [Kerberos](https://youtu.be/5N242XcKAsM?si=hpCSADRauVUlo7Hy)
- [Kerberos Authentication Overview | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/kerberos-authentication-overview) 
![[kerberos-authentication-illustration.jpg]]
1. KDC = Key Distribution Center
2. If client credentials are valid the KDC emits a Ticket Granting Ticket
3. Before accessing a specifc service the client sends the TGT again back to the KDC to have a new ticket scoped on the target service.
4. Until this new ticket expires, the client can have access to the target server without repeating the authn process.
Cons:
- [pass-the-ticket attack]([Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass the Ticket, Sub-technique T1550.003 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003/))
- [Kerberoasting]([Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets: Kerberoasting, Sub-technique T1558.003 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1558/003/))
- Missing sync between servers clocks


## Guest Users

Authn happens against their IdP (social network, external AD, mail...) while authZ happens against our service (Oauth2)

## EntraAD B2B

## EntraAD B2C

## EntraAD Domain Service

## Conditional Access:

Apply policies to target

- users (external, groups, roles)
- Actions (registration...)
- Apps
- Platforms
- Locations

To require:

- [MFA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks)  
    Number matching prevents accidental approval by requiring the user to type in a two-digit code from the login screen to their Authenticator app.

- something you **know** (psw)
- Smt you **have** (usb key, mobile app...)
- Smt you **are** (fingerprint)

- Allow only enrolled devices
- IP filtering (named locations)
- VPN
- certificate based auth
- [passkeys (FIDO2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-enable-passkey-fido2) 
  an MFA setup might include:
	1. **Something You Have**: A FIDO2 security key or a mobile device with FIDO2 capabilities.
	2. **Something You Are**: Biometric verification like a fingerprint or facial recognition.
	3. **Something You Know**: A password or PIN.

To then report [risky users and accesses](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks#risk-detections-mapped-to-riskeventtype) (malicious IP, psw spray, anonymous IP...)

# AUTHZ

## OAuth2

is an authz method where third party apps can get authorized on behalf of a user to web hosted resources (MSGraph, Az Key Vaults...) by exchanging [tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-protocols#tokens) provided by the IdP.

The [tokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-protocols#tokens) are given by Az Identity and validated by MSGraph API.

[Explore Microsoft Graph - Training | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/microsoft-graph/)

[Microsoft Graph Fundamentals - Training | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/paths/m365-msgraph-fundamentals/)

Tokens can be

- ID tokens
- Access tokens: are sent in the http req as bearer tokens in the Authorization header
- Refresh tokens

In OAuth2 permissions are called scopes.

- [Microsoft identity platform token exchange scenario with SAML and OIDC/OAuth in Microsoft Entra ID - Microsoft identity platform | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/scenario-token-exchange-saml-oauth)
- [MSAL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/msal-overview)

- [Golang Azure MSAL](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-go)

Permissions can be:

- Delegated: a user must be present to sign-in
- App-only: background services apps (daemons)

Consent type:

- Static: need to know all the resources in advance
- Dynamic: you can increment the scope access over time
- Admin


# User management
## [Administrative Units](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/administrative-units)

Administrative units restrict permissions in a role to any portion of your organization that you define (geographical, business unit...), if you assign a role to a user that is not a member of an administrative unit, the scope of the role is the entire tenant.

You can assign the user to an administrative unit, group, or Microsoft Entra role when the account is created. You can assign the user to up to 20 groups or roles.

A.U. can't be nested. 
[Entra ID Governance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/identity-governance-overview) can't manage A.U.

## Users

External Identities

B2B collaboration is a feature within Microsoft Entra External ID that lets you invite guest users to collaborate with your organization.

The partner uses their own identity management solution, so there's no external administrative overhead for your organization.

## Groups

Members can include: users, service principals, groups, devices.

Options:

- AD Roles can be assigned
- Membership:

- Assigned
- Dynamic users membership (query rules)
- Dynamic device

- Name, Description
- Owners

Microsoft 365 Groups: share access to calendar, Teams channels, SharePoint sites...

## Roles

RBAC can give specific permissions to some user or group to a given scope like a management group, a resource group, a resource or an entire subscription.

Policies

- Tracking compliance
- Offers remediations
- Track Events

### Global Administrator
Suggested to have less than 5. Can revoke MFA and edit all other roles.



## Resources

Subscription > Management group > resource group > resource > resource internal scope.

Can be locked.

I can deploy a template of resources through a BLUEPRINT.

### PIM (Privileged Identity Management)

Give the roles just in time for a limited amount of time.


# NETWORKING

## LOAD BALANCER

L4 (TCP/UDP), REGIONAL

can be internal or external (get assigned a Public IP)

## APP GATEWAY

L7, REGIONAL: redirection, rewrite, https,

Can have on top a WAF ([OWASP threats](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/application-gateway-crs-rulegroups-rules?tabs=drs21#owasp-crs-32))

## AZ [FRONT DOOR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/frontdoor/front-door-overview)

L7,  GLOBAL

Uses [anycast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast) to manage the connection as close as possible to the client ( the lowest number of [BGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_gateway_protocol) network hops) with hundreds of PoPs (point of  presence) CDN connected through a high speed WAN.

## NSG – Network Security Group (L4)

Allows us to groups network resources through tags instead of caring of IPs

SUBNET specifics

- Service endpoint: identifies an internal subnet to be allowed to call other internal services by allowing it in the target service firewall
- Private endpoint: identifies a specific service instance inside a private subnet. Requires also a DNS configuration in order to be found by other internal services.

## FIREWALL

L4: network rules

L7: app rules (FQDN, TLS inspection, URL filtering, IDPR = Intrusion Detection Protection System)

[ROUTING](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview)

Az automatically creates routing tables for each new subnet adding system default routes.

You don't need to define route tables or gateways for Azure to route traffic between subnets.

- Parent VNet prefix
- 0.0.0.0/0 Internet
- 10.0.0.0/8 None
- 192.168/16, 172.16/12 None

[UDR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview#user-defined)

When you create a route table and associate it to a subnet, the table's routes are combined with the subnet's default routes. If there are conflicting route assignments, user-defined routes override the default routes.

- Virtual appliance: private VM inet, private LB IP
- [VNet VPN GW](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways)
- VNet
- None
- Internet

[Diagnose an Azure virtual machine routing problem | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/diagnose-network-routing-problem)

## ExpressRoute

Dedicated physical connection to an Azure tenant

## VPN

IpSec/K encrypted connection.

- P2P
- Point to site
- Site to site

Can be established also inside an ExpressRoute connection.
