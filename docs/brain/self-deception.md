Sigmund Freud’s theory of self-deception and protection is primarily encapsulated in his concept of **defense mechanisms**. These are unconscious strategies that the ego uses to protect itself from **anxiety** and to maintain psychological equilibrium. 
Here are some key points:

### **Freud’s Theory of Defense Mechanisms**

1. **==Repression==**: This is the cornerstone of Freud’s defense mechanisms. It involves pushing distressing thoughts, memories, or desires out of conscious awareness.
2. ==**Denial**==: Refusing to accept reality or facts, thereby blocking external events from awareness.
3. **Projection**: Attributing one’s own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to someone else.
4. **Rationalization**: Creating logical explanations for behaviors or feelings that are actually driven by unconscious motives.
5. **Displacement**: Redirecting emotions from a threatening target to a safer one.
6. **Sublimation**: Channeling unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable activities.
7. **Regression**: Reverting to behaviors characteristic of an earlier stage of development when faced with stress.

### **Self-Deception and the Splitting of the Ego**

[Freud also discussed the concept of **self-deception** in terms of the “splitting of the ego.” This involves a division within the ego where one part remains aware of the truth while another part denies it, allowing the individual to hold contradictory beliefs simultaneously](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/philosophical-essays-on-freud/selfdeception-and-the-splitting-of-the-ego/1477BAF77C0CD1D390C44A7A1A0C36D7)[1](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/philosophical-essays-on-freud/selfdeception-and-the-splitting-of-the-ego/1477BAF77C0CD1D390C44A7A1A0C36D7).

### **Modern Validity**

Freud’s ideas on defense mechanisms have been influential and remain relevant in modern psychology, though they have been refined and expanded upon. 
Contemporary research supports the existence of defense mechanisms, though the specifics of Freud’s original theories are often debated. For example:

- [**Empirical Support**: Modern psychology has found evidence for many of Freud’s defense mechanisms, such as repression and denial](https://www.verywellmind.com/defense-mechanisms-2795960)[2](https://www.verywellmind.com/defense-mechanisms-2795960).
- [**Cognitive Dissonance**: The concept of cognitive dissonance, introduced by Leon Festinger, aligns with Freud’s ideas about self-deception, suggesting that people are motivated to reduce the discomfort of holding conflicting beliefs](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/philosophical-essays-on-freud/selfdeception-and-the-splitting-of-the-ego/1477BAF77C0CD1D390C44A7A1A0C36D7)[1](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/philosophical-essays-on-freud/selfdeception-and-the-splitting-of-the-ego/1477BAF77C0CD1D390C44A7A1A0C36D7).
- [**Neuroscience**: Advances in neuroscience have provided insights into how the brain processes and manages conflicting information, supporting some of Freud’s ideas about unconscious processes](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/philosophical-essays-on-freud/selfdeception-and-the-splitting-of-the-ego/1477BAF77C0CD1D390C44A7A1A0C36D7)[3](https://bing.com/search?q=Sigmund+Freud+theory+of+self-deception+and+protection).

Overall, while some aspects of Freud’s theories have been modified or challenged, the core idea that people use unconscious strategies to protect themselves from psychological distress remains a significant and validated concept in modern psychology.
