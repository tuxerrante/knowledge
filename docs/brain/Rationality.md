**a more rational reasoning process tends to arrive at true beliefs and good decisions more often than a less rational process.** For example, a reasoning process that responds to evidence is more likely to believe true things than one that just goes with what's convenient to believe.

The goal of conversations is to figure out what's true, not to win arguments.

To be [_Bayesian_](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/bayesianism):
- Rather than treating belief as binary, use **probabilistic credences** to express our certainty/uncertainty. 
- Try [_Bayesian evidence_](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6s3xABaXKPdFwA3FS/what-is-evidence) for or against a hypothesis,

[What Do We Mean By "Rationality"? — LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/NBDFAKt3GbFwnwzQF/p/RcZCwxFiZzE6X7nsv)

**Epistemic Rationality**: This type of rationality is concerned with forming beliefs that are as accurate as possible. It involves using evidence and logical reasoning to ensure that one’s beliefs correspond to reality. The goal is to hold beliefs that are true and to avoid false beliefs.

**Instrumental Rationality**: This focuses on making decisions that effectively achieve one’s goals. It involves choosing actions based on their expected outcomes and how well they align with one’s objectives. The emphasis is on the practical effectiveness of decisions rather than their truthfulness.

**Probability Theory**: This is used to evaluate the likelihood of various events and to update beliefs in light of new evidence. It provides a mathematical framework for dealing with uncertainty and making predictions.

**Decision Theory**: This theory is concerned with choosing the best action among various alternatives based on their expected outcomes. It involves evaluating the potential benefits and risks of different actions to make rational choices that maximize one’s goals.

### Challenges in Rationality

**Bayesian Formalism**: While Bayesian methods provide a comprehensive framework for updating beliefs and making decisions, they can be impractical for real-world problems due to their complexity and computational demands.

**Debates on Rules**: There are ongoing debates about the exact rules and principles that should govern rational belief and decision-making. Different schools of thought propose various modifications and alternatives to classical probability and decision theory.

### Practical Application

**Overcoming Biases**: Rationality involves recognizing and overcoming cognitive biases that can distort our thinking. This includes biases like confirmation bias, where we favor information that confirms our preexisting beliefs, and availability bias, where we overestimate the importance of information that is readily available.

**[[Self-Deception]]**: Rationality also requires us to be honest with ourselves about our beliefs and motivations. Self-deception can lead to holding false beliefs and making poor decisions.
	humans can look at an illusion and realize that ==part of what we’re seeing is the lens itself==. You don’t always have to believe your own eyes, but you have to realize that you _have_ eyes — you must have distinct mental buckets for the map and the territory, for the senses and reality. Lest you think this a trivial ability, remember how rare it is in the animal kingdom.

**Aligning Beliefs and Actions**: The ultimate goal of rationality is to ensure that our beliefs accurately reflect reality and that our actions effectively achieve our goals. This involves continuous self-reflection and adjustment of our beliefs and strategies in response to new information and changing circumstances.
