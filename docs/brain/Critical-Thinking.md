## What
- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical\_thinking):  
  - “***Critical thinking is the analysis of facts to form a judgment***”  

  - The subject is complex, and **several different definitions exist**, which generally include the **rational**, **sceptical**, **unbiased** analysis, or evaluation of **factual evidence**.  

  - Critical thinking is **self-directed**, **self-disciplined**, **self-monitored**, and **self-corrective thinking**.  
  - It presupposes assent to rigorous standards of excellence and mindful command of their use.  

  - It entails **effective communication** and **problem-solving** abilities as well as a commitment to overcome native **egocentrism** and **sociocentrism**.  

- [The Foundation of Critical Thinking](https://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/defining-critical-thinking/766) (short definition by [Linda Elder](https://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/dr-linda-elder/819), September, 2007\)  

  - Critical thinking is self-guided, self-disciplined thinking which attempts to reason at the highest level of quality in a fair-minded way.  

  - People who think critically consistently attempt to live rationally, reasonably, **empathically**.  

  - They are keenly aware of the **inherently flawed nature of human thinking when left unchecked**.  

  - They strive to diminish the power of their egocentric and sociocentric tendencies.    

  - They use the intellectual tools that critical thinking offers – concepts and principles that enable them to analyze, assess, and improve thinking.  

  - They work diligently to develop the intellectual virtues of intellectual integrity, intellectual humility, intellectual civility, intellectual empathy, intellectual sense of justice and confidence in reason.  

  - They realize that **no matter how skilled they are as thinkers, they can always improve their reasoning abilities** and they will at times fall prey to **mistakes in reasoning**, human irrationality, prejudices, biases, distortions, **uncritically accepted social rules and taboos**, self-interest, and vested interest.  

  - They strive to **improve the world in whatever ways they can and contribute to a more rational, civilized society**. At the same time, they recognize the complexities often inherent in doing so.  

  - They **avoid thinking simplistically about complicated issues** and strive to appropriately consider the rights and needs of relevant others.  

  - They recognize the complexities in developing as thinkers, and commit themselves to **life-long practice toward self-improvement**.  

  - They embody the Socratic principle: “**The unexamined life is not worth living**”, because they realize that many unexamined lives together result in an uncritical, unjust, dangerous world.

[Why is it so hard to teach](https://www.readingrockets.org/article/critical-thinking-why-it-so-hard-teach)  

  - Obviously it’s not black/white, not a “matter of kind” but “a matter of degree”.  

  - If I had to pick one battle, a single battle, I’d spend my life exposing high school students to Critical Thinking
