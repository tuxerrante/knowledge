- Knowledge is described as "**true justified belief**."
- Beliefs are categorized into different types such as **intuition** (unjustifiable) and **opinion** (justifiable). The lecture explains that beliefs are not binary but exist on a continuum of justification, ranging from intuition to knowledge.
- Two primary internalist approaches to belief justification are discussed: 
  **Foundationalism**, which relies on self-justifying foundational beliefs, 
  and **Coherentism**, which emphasizes the coherence among a network of beliefs without relying on self-evident foundational beliefs.
	- a movie or a book novel can be very coherent but completely made up
- **Externalism** argues that justification should connect internal beliefs with the external world. It highlights the importance of accurate perception and belief formation processes, linking internal beliefs to external reality.

Can we have knowledge?
- **Dogmatism** asserts that knowledge is possible, 
- **Skepticism** doubts the possibility of knowledge. 
- **Epistemic Relativism**, which claims that truth is relative, which is  problematic because it contradicts the objective nature of truth.
	- extreme: subjectivism, everyone is a whole universe
	- moderate: conventionalism, relative to a close context (family, culture)
