## **Productivity**

[Getting To The Top 1% Of Amazon Engineers \- Productivity Tips From A Life Engineered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj75QsirVHE)

* The key to productivity is doing more of what matters and less of what doesn't.  
  Being busy and being productive are not the same thing. Running around in circles is busy. Going toward your destination is productive. It's easy to be busy. It's hard to be productive.   
  **Farnam Street**

Stop trying to be spectacular. Start being consistent.
Your reputation isn't built on your best day. It's built on your worst
FS

Start small and learn fast. 
Your first move doesn't need to be perfect; it just needs to teach you something. Focus more on the next small step that moves you closer to the goal.
Motion creates momentum, and momentum reveals opportunities that standing still never could.

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
Wealth creation is an evolutionarily recent positive-sum game. Status is an old zero-sum gam. N.Ravikant

## **Happiness**

- Stop overthinking:  
  - if you tried and you failed.. nice try\!  
  - if you’re trying to sleep.. everything else is useless, just deep breathing and sleep.  
  - if someone else did something bad to you, you can’t control it. Let it go.  
- Don’t skip gym. Your brain also needs that.

- “You are better equipped to deal with stress when you are moving.
When you feel tense or frustrated or worried, it is difficult to think your way into feeling better. The more you think about the situation, the larger it becomes in your mind. Trying to think your way out of it often leads to a spiral of overthinking and rumination.
