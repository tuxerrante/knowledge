# Ops

**Dashboard**:
- **Grafana** is an open-source analytics and monitoring platform. It integrates seamlessly with Prometheus to visualize metrics. You can create dashboards to monitor the health and performance of your AKS clusters.
- Kibana

**Logs**:
- **OpenTelemetry**: a unified approach to collecting metrics, logs, and traces.¬†It‚Äôs an observability framework that supports multiple backends, including Prometheus and Jaeger ([logz](https://logz.io/blog/open-source-monitoring-tools/)).
- **Fluentd**: For log aggregation, Fluentd can be used to collect and forward logs to various destinations, including Elasticsearch and [Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/monitor-kubernetes).

**Metrics**:
- **Prometheus** is a powerful open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. It can scrape metrics from your AKS clusters and store them in a time-series database. You can set up Prometheus to monitor various metrics from your Kubernetes environment.

**Traces**:
- [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) is an open-source tool for tracing and monitoring microservices. It helps you understand the performance of your microservices by providing end-to-end distributed tracing. You can deploy Jaeger in your AKS cluster to collect and visualize traces.

**Alerts**:
- Site 24x7
- Alertmanager works with Prometheus to handle alerts. It can route alerts to different receivers like email, Slack, MS Teams, or other notification systems. You can configure Alertmanager to manage and silence alerts based on your requirements.
