One of the most powerful ways to design your life is to design your lives. ~ Dave Evans 

Deciding which worries are worth your effort is one of the most important decisions ever. ” 

- Health
- Work
- Play
- Love 
Reflect on each area of your life and rank them from zero to one hundred, with zero being the least important. Then, try to find an actionable problem in each segment you can tackle.” 

“Gravity problems are predicaments that are not actionable or solvable” 

“to find direction in life, we must establish coherence between our workview and lifeview. That is, who we are, what we believe, and what we do must align. ” 

“Logging whatever you are doing in the **Good Time Journal** is essential for understanding which activities drain you and which bring you joy.” 

“When we put all our eggs in one basket by focusing on a single way out of a situation, we invariably put a lot of pressure on ourselves, making it difficult to make logical decisions.” 
Don’t make the mistake of focusing solely on the first idea that comes to your mind or what you believe to be a perfect idea.” 


“Make the **mind map**. 
Write down your topic in the center of a blank sheet of paper and circle it. Draw four lines, in different directions, from that circle. 
Write four things related to that central idea at the end of each line. Then draw four lines from each of the new points and write down four words associated with it. This step is complete when you have five levels of word associations.
Make secondary connections and create concepts. Look at the associations you’ve compiled. Choose the most interesting ones. Combine them and create a few concepts.” 

“You need an **Odyssey Plan** if you want to make a life design. You must devise three life paths in the next five years to do this.” 

“We can always choose to be happy.”
