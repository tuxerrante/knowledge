## 1. No one is crazy:

“On the one hand capitalism helps you accumulate wealth that can be transferred to your kids after you're dead. That's the good part. The other side of the coin is that it fosters envy. The type of envy that turns you into a perpetual money chaser.”

## 5. Don't aim to be rich, aim to be wealthy
“Wealth is the money you save and invest. It's the assets you own. And that's the thing people don't see. What most people see is the display of riches and anyone can appear to be rich. Matter of fact, many people who look rich are actually broke.” 

“it doesn't make sense to impress people at your own expense. Focus on building wealth, not showcasing riches you can't afford.” 

## Conclusions 
Investors must have no sunk cost.
Join an investment club.
