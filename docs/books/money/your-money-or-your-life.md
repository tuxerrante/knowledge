## Face your financial reality
Humans are creatures of habit [[books/atomic-habits]], 
stuck in patterns not aligned with reality.
To overcome prejudice you must create your own roadmap.

### **Net worth**

## Prejudice VS money

- Practical realm: daily transactions
- Psychological realm: your prejudice and beliefs about money coming from your family and your culture
- Cultural realm: shared beliefs about money (eg: USA VS Italy opposite debt/savings habits)
- Personal responsibility realm: you must understand that money is just a token exchanged for life energy, finite and tangible. Money has no intrinsic reality.

### BALANCE SHEET
- how much time do you invest in your job?
  Calculate real hourly wage for all job related expenses and activities.
  Add job-related hours to your spreadsheet and subtract them from your salary.

## Budgeting equals diet culture
