# **Productivity**

[Getting To The Top 1% Of Amazon Engineers \- Productivity Tips From A Life Engineered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj75QsirVHE)

* The key to productivity is doing more of what matters and less of what doesn't.  
  Being busy and being productive are not the same thing. Running around in circles is busy. Going toward your destination is productive. It's easy to be busy. It's hard to be productive.

### **Every day work**

- double check your morning focus TODO list: most impactful task first

### **Meetings:**

- Only in the afternoon  
- Block the first three hours of the day for the most important task, no interruptions  
- 

### **Cellphone**

- upside down, no sound, check notifications only at lunch and after 16:00  
- 

# **Happiness**

- Stop overthinking:  
  - if you tried and you failed.. nice try\!  
  - if you’re trying to sleep.. everything else is useless, just deep breathing and sleep.  
  - if someone else did something bad to you, you can’t control it. Let it go.  
- Don’t skip gym. Your brain also needs that.

### **Routine**

eg: work from home

22:00 alarm to stop everything and go to sleep  
	only reading from paper or an eBook something **you like**

7:00 alarm with low volume and no vibration.   
	Repeat each 10 mins to no to wake up tired

7:30 breakfast and clean something 

→ no phone, no emails, no socials

8:00 \- 9:30 focused work 

9:30 \- 10:00 daily meeting

10:30 \- 12:00 focused work

12:30 \- 13:00 gym

13:00 \- 14:00 lunch

14:00 \- 18:00 meetings, emails, documentation, tests…
